# Formspree Integration Setup

## What's Been Done

I've successfully integrated Formspree into your contact form while maintaining the exact same look and appearance. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made:

1. **HTML Form Updated** (`index.html`):
   - Added Formspree action URL: `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID"`
   - Added POST method: `method="POST"`
   - All existing styling and structure preserved

2. **JavaScript Enhanced** (`script.js`):
   - Added async form submission handling
   - Implemented loading states with multilingual support
   - Added error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Maintained all existing animations and interactions
   - Added proper form reset functionality

3. **CSS Styling** (`styles.css`):
   - Added disabled state styles for the submit button
   - Maintained all existing visual design

### Features Added:

- ✅ **Loading State**: Shows "Versturen..." (or equivalent in other languages) while submitting
- ✅ **Success State**: Shows "✓ Verzonden!" with green checkmark
- ✅ **Error State**: Shows "❌ Fout opgetreden" if submission fails
- ✅ **Multilingual Support**: All messages work in Dutch, English, German, and Portuguese
- ✅ **Form Reset**: Automatically clears form after successful submission
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Button states change appropriately during submission

## Next Steps - REQUIRED:

### 1. Get Your Formspree ID

1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create an account
2. Create a new form
3. Copy your form ID (it will look something like `xrgjqkqr`)

### 2. Replace the Placeholder

In `index.html`, find this line:
```html
<form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID" method="POST">
```

Replace `YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID` with your actual Formspree form ID:
```html
<form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/xrgjqkqr" method="POST">
```

### 3. Test the Form

1. Open your website
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit it
4. Check your Formspree dashboard to see the submission

## How It Works

1. **User fills form** → Same beautiful interface as before
2. **User clicks submit** → Button shows loading state
3. **Form submits to Formspree** → Data sent to your Formspree endpoint
4. **Success/Error response** → User sees appropriate message
5. **Form resets** → Ready for next submission

## Form Fields

The form includes these fields that will be sent to Formspree:
- `name` (required)
- `email` (required) 
- `phone` (optional)
- `message` (required)

## Customization

If you want to customize the messages or add more fields:

1. **Messages**: Edit the translation objects in `script.js` (lines ~1077-1120)
2. **Fields**: Add new form fields in `index.html` and they'll automatically be included
3. **Styling**: All existing CSS classes work with new fields

## Support

The form maintains all existing functionality:
- ✅ Floating labels
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility features
- ✅ Multilingual support
- ✅ Smooth animations

Your contact form is now ready to collect real submissions through Formspree while maintaining the exact same beautiful design!
